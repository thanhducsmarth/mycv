# Product Context: Thanh Duc Photo Portfolio

## Why This Project Exists

The thanhducphoto portfolio website was created to establish a strong online presence for Than Duc as a professional photographer. In today's digital world, photographers need a compelling online showcase to attract clients, collaborations, and opportunities.

## Problems This Solves

1. **Limited Exposure**: Traditional portfolio showcases are often PDF-based or limited to social media platforms that don't do justice to high-quality photography. This website provides a dedicated, optimized space for viewing photos at full quality.

2. **Professional Credibility**: A custom portfolio site demonstrates technical proficiency and seriousness as a professional photographer, setting Than Duc apart from hobbyists or social media-only photographers.

3. **Client Acquisition**: Potential clients can easily discover work, understand style and capabilities, and have a direct channel to engage with the photographer.

4. **Work Organization**: Photography work spans multiple genres and projects. A dedicated site allows for better categorization and storytelling around different photo series.
