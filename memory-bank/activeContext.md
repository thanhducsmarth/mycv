# Active Context: Thanh Duc Photo Development

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus is establishing the foundation for Thanh Duc's photography portfolio website by implementing a clean, responsive photo gallery. The goal is to create an elegant platform that showcases photography work effectively while building a maintainable codebase.

## Recent Changes (Chronological)

### Project Initialization
- **10/21/2025 11:33**: Created memory-bank/ directory for project documentation
- **11:33**: Initialized projectbrief.md defining scope as photography portfolio with interactive gallery
- **11:34**: Created productContext.md outlining user experience goals and business value
- **11:34**: Set up techContext.md documenting Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS stack
- **11:34**: Established systemPatterns.md with App Router architecture and responsive design patterns

### Active Development State
- Memory Bank documentation complete for project foundation
- Ready to implement gallery component in app/page.tsx
- Using default Next.js scaffolding as starting point

## Next Steps (Immediate Tasks)

1. **Modify app/page.tsx**: Replace default welcome content with photo gallery layout
2. **Create images directory**: Set up public/images/ for photo assets
3. **Add placeholder images**: Use stock photography or abstract images for development
4. **Implement responsive grid**: CSS Grid with Tailwind breakpoints (mobile: 1 col, tablet: 2 col, desktop: 3-4 col)
5. **Optimize image loading**: Use Next.js Image component with priority and lazy loading
6. **Test responsiveness**: Verify gallery works across screen sizes

## Pending Tasks (This Session)

- Finalize gallery component structure
- Add basic SEO metadata
- Prepare for real photo integration
- Document component usage patterns

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technology Choices Confirmed
- **Next.js 15**: App Router for modern architecture and built-in optimizations
- **React 19**: Latest features for performance (not yet needing experimental APIs in this simple use case)
- **TailwindCSS 4**: Utility-first approach matches photography "minimal UI, maximum content" philosophy

### Design Decisions
- **Grid-based Gallery**: CSS Grid provides better control than masonry or flex layouts for photography
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: Standard Tailwind (sm/md/lg/xl) for consistent cross-device experience
- **Aspect Ratio Consistency**: Photos will maintain consistent ratios (likely 4:3 or square for initial implementation)
- **Minimal UI Elements**: Focus on photo display, avoid navigation clutter

### Performance Considerations
- **Image Optimization Priority**: Photography portfolio success depends on fast, crisp image loading
- **Static Generation**: Use `export` or hybrid rendering for optimal performance
- **Bundle Size**: Keep JavaScript minimal - this is primarily a static gallery

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Functional components over class components
- TypeScript strict mode for reliability
- Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX
- Component separation only when logic complexity justifies it

### Styling Conventions
- Mobile-first responsive design with `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes
- Consistent spacing scale using factors of 4 (4px, 8px, 16px, etc.)
- White space-dominant design with generous padding
- Consistent color system (neutral grays, minimal accent colors)

### Image Handling
- All photos in `/public/images/` directory
- Named descriptively for SEO (`portrait-smiling-couple.jpg`)
- Optimized for web (suitable file formats, sizes)
- Descriptive alt texts for accessibility and SEO

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- Next.js 15 setup with Turbopack provides excellent development experience
- React 19 integration appears stable for this simple portfolio use case
- TailwindCSS 4 has simplified configuration compared to v3
- Memory Bank documentation approach is effective for maintaining context across sessions

### Project Insights
- Photography portfolios benefit from minimal navigation and maximal image display
- Mobile responsiveness is critical - many photo discoveries happen on mobile devices
- Fast loading is essential - photography sites that are slow lose credibility
- Gallery design should scale from 6-12 initial photos to hundreds over time

This foundation positions the project for smooth evolution to include categories, about pages, and advanced features while maintaining performance and clean code.
